      <h4>Definition</h4>
      <p>
        Substitutability is a principle stating that, if S is a subtype of T,
        then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., an
        object of type T may be substituted with any object of a subtype S)
        without altering any of the desirable properties of the program
        (correctness, task performed, etc.). For example if function takes as an
        argument the base class, it should be also able to take as an argument
        the derived class without breaking the functionality of the function.
