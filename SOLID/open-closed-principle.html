      <h4>Definition</h4>
      <p>
        The open&minus;closed principle states "software entities (classes,
        modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for
        modification", an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without
        modifying its source code.
      </p>
      <p>
        This principle is usually achieved by using interfaces and abstract
        classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding additional cases to a switch or methods to a class is bad,
        because that class might be a part of tests or inheritance, that is why
        modifying it is bad.
