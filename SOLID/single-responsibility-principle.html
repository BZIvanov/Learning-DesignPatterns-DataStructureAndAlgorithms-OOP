      <h4>Definition</h4>
      <p>
        The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a principle that states
        that every module, class or function in a program should have
        responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and
        it should encapsulate that part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using SRP makes also the debugging easier, because if we have a bug with
        some functionality, we know exactly where to search.
