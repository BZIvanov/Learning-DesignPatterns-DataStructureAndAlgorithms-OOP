      <h4>Definition</h4>
      <p>
        The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a principle that states
        that every module, class or function in a program should have
        responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and
        it should encapsulate that part.
      </p>

      <p>Following the SRP leads to lower coupling and higher cohesion.</p>
