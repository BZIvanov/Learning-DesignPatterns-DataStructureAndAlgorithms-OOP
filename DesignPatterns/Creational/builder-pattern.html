      Constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Builder pattern we can build only the properties of objects we need,
      not to provide as undefined the ones we don't need for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having an object with for example 10 initial arguments is not very
      productive and the Builder pattern is a way to build an object with all
      the required properties step by step.
