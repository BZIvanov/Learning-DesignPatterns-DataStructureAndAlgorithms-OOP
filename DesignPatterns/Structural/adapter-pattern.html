    <p>
      Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping
      its own interface around that of an already existing class.
    </p>
    <p>It is about making 2 incompatible interfaces compatible.</p>
    <p>
      It is not about changing the behaviour of the adaptee, only to make it
      compatible (usable)
