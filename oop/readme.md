## OOP with javascript

- **inheritance** - An object (class would be better word in traditional oop) being able to inherit methods and properties from another object. Inheritance also means giving one object access to another object's methods and properties. The main benefit from inheritance is the code reuse.

- **encapsulation** - Enclosing all functionalities of an object (data and methods) within the object, so the objects internal work is hidden from the rest of our application. The main benefit from encapsulation is that it governs the creation of our objects.
