## Bounded context (BC)

Specific responsibility enforced by an explicit boundary.

Bounded context help us with deciding of how to split our domains in defferent microservices, because it is often not clear where to put boundaries.

### Bounded context structure

- each bounded context has its own ubiquitous language

- has its own independent implementation (e.g. CQRS)

- has external interface (to other contexts)

### Bounded context keypoints

- remove ambiguity and duplication

- simplify design of software modules

- integration of external components
