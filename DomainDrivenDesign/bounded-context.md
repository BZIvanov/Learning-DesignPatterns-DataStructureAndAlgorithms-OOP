## Bounded context (BC)

Specific responsibility enforced by an explicit boundary.

### Bounded context structure

- each bounded context has its own ubiquitous language

- has its own independent implementation (e.g. CQRS)

- has external interface (to other contexts)

### Bounded context keypoints

- remove ambiguity and duplication

- simplify design of software modules

- integration of external components
