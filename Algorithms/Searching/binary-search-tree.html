      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Keynotes about the binary search tree algorithm:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The top of the tree is called 'root'</li>
        <li>
          Binary tree is called binary, because each node has maximum of 2
          branches/children
        </li>
        <li>Leaf nodes are the ends of the tree, nodes with no children</li>
        <li>
          Binary trees are ordered, each left subtree is less than or equal to
          the parent node and each right subtree is greater or equal to the
          parent node
        </li>
      </ul>
