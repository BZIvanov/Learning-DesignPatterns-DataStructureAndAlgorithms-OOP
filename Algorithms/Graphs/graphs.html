      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Graph is a data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges which
        are the connections between nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trees are also special kind of graphs, because for trees we need to
        fullfil some conditions to call them trees. Trees have one root and only
        one unique path between any two nodes.
