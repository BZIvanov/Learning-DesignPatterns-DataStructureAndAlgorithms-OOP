## Clean Architecture

1. Entities - the center of the architecture.
2. Use cases - around the center.
3. Controllers, Gateways, Presenters - around use cases.
4. Devices, Web, DB, UI, External interfaces - these are the 4th layer.

The Clean architecture follows the logic from the Domain-centric architecture, where the Domain is in the center.
